# MetaHex

Instructions:


Selection Screen:

Height and Length prompt box:  You can set the height and length of the lattice, the bigger the lattice, the more time to auto-solve.
  Soft Mode Buttons: 8 buttons with numbers on them. you can set which soft modes are enabled, if you later set a hexagon to a soft mode you didn't choose, it will write the soft mode and display a red x on it.

Hex Lattice: In Hex mode it will create a giant hexagon made out of normal hexagons, there is no height, only length, which determines what will be the side length of the giant hex.
  Periodic Button: will automatically link up the edges so the folded lattice created would be able to tile infinitely.  so when you click one of the edges it will automatically set the compatible edge on the opposite side. In hex lattice mode it's disabled.

Auto Button:  Tries to fill the hexagons with an equal amount of each chosen soft mode without any frustration. Will attempt all possible configurations with the given height and length, with the chosen soft modes and respecting if the periodic button is on or not.  It stops when it finds a working solution (which it will show on screen) or when there are no solutions (a big red x will show on screen). Note: if the height or length is 1, then auto-solve will not work properly.
  Photo Mode Button: Only works when the auto-solve button is on. when a solution is found automatically, it will save it as a picture to a folder named "autoSolves" which is in the folder named "MetaHex_Data". With buttons the variations and the more auto buttons, it will save all of the found solutions. Notes: doesn't work on the web version, if left to run on a big lattice for a long time it will fill up your pc.
  Variations Button: Only works when the auto-solve button is on. Finds all of the possible solutions to the selected settings, when it's done, it will show on screen how many different solutions were found. Note: runs significantly better when the photo mode button is off.
  
More Auto Button: Only works when the auto-solve button is on. Should only be used with photo mode on and if paired with variations, it will take a very long time. It runs over every combination of the amount of soft modes chosen and tries to find a solution to every one of them. Note: you should only choose the starting soft modes, so for example, if you want to go over all of the 3 soft modes combinations, you need to only choose soft mods 1, 2 and 3a.
  Confirm Button: After setting everything up press it and you will go to the lattice screen.

  
Lattice Screen:

in order to decide where a beam will fold, you need to press slightly toward where you want it to flip to, if you want it to reset, press where it was originally. Once all 6 beams of a hex have been folded it will show on the hex its soft mode number and it will show a red x if it wasn't chosen at the start.

Reset Button: it resets the screen to what it was right after you pressed confirm.

Back Button: Goes back to the selection screen, it should remember and keep your settings

Auto Button: will try and find a solution using all of the settings from the selection screen and without changing any beams you already changed in the lattice.

Variations Button: will try and find all of the variations that are using the settings from the selection screen (respecting photo mode I think) and are using your current changed beams.
